# CaramellaBot

This is a funny game translated to a Telegram Bot.

Rules are simple:
1. Create a game;
2. Let people join;
3. Start the game;
4. Follow the instructions (only in Italian and English right now) that the bot writes in the private chat and wait that all other players answer the same questions;
5. The bot will mix all the answers to form some stories;
6. The bot pastes the stories in the main group chat.

The game is simple, and reading the assembled stories is funny!

Try it including @CaramellaBOT to your group chat!
